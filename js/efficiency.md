### Efficiency of an Algorithm

Binary search is faster than linear

Big O 
- theoretical def of the complexity of an algorithm as a function of the size
- Notation used to describe complexity

Complexity is relative
- when we evaluate the complexity of the binary search algorithm, we're doing it relative to other search algorithms not all algorithms

Time complexity in programming refers to the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as the size of the input grows. It is a measure of the efficiency of an algorithm, which is expressed in terms of the number of basic operations performed by the algorithm.

The time complexity of an algorithm is usually represented using the "Big O" notation, which is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function as the input size approaches infinity. For example, an algorithm with a time complexity of O(n) means that the running time of the algorithm grows linearly with the input size n.

In general, it is desirable to have algorithms with lower time complexity, as they can process larger inputs in less time. However, the time complexity of an algorithm is not the only factor to consider when evaluating its efficiency, as there may be other factors such as space complexity, the simplicity of the code, and ease of maintainability that are also important.
